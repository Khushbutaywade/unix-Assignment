Write a script that will use command substitution to dynamically set variable values:

TODAYSDATE - should contain date/time stamp when executed
USERFILES - the results of a find run on the /home directory to list all files owned by 'user' account


Additionally, set two aliases:

TODAY - should be an alias for the 'date' command
UFILES - should be an alias to the full command used to set the variable USERFILES above

Finally, display all variables and alias values when the script is run.

Ans: echo "1.TODAYSDATE"
echo "2.USERFILES"
echo "Enter your choice"
read choice
case $choice in
1) TODAYSDATE=`date`
echo $TODAYSDATE
;;
2) USERFILES= ls
echo $USERFILES
;;
