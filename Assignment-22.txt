Create a script to demonstrate the visibility of variables and when they are available within a script and its functions. Define a global variable, a function that defines a local variable and then display both BEFORE calling the function, call the function, then display both AFTER calling the function.
Ans : print(){
              name ="local"
              echo "This is $name variable: in the fuction"
}
name="global"
echo "This is $name variable: before"
print 
echo "This is $name variable: After"
